        The computer language is in form of notation.

    =   What are features of a computer programming language?
        1.  The program is executed by sequence of line number
        2.  The execution may branch to another line
        3.  It jumps
        4.  Loop/Iterate across one or more lines repeatedly
        5.  Ability to solve equations

        3 x 3 - 3 / 3 + 3
        =   9 - 1 + 3
        =   9 + 2
        =   11

    =   There are 3 types of computer languages:
        1.  Passive language
            A computer language that is used for presentation purpose

                     SGML - Standard Generalized Markup Language

        2.  Active language
            Are used for solving mission critical algorithmic problems.
            The program resides in the local machine and runs using the
            resources of the residing machine.

        3.  Dynamic language

    =   8 bit (ASCII) can generate 2^8 = 256 combinations
        ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange
        16 bit (UNICODE) can generate 2^16 = 35536 combinations

    =   ASSIGNMENT:

    =   There are 3 types of attributes:

    =   CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet
    =   CSS is used for formatting the HTML page and styling the elements.
    =   CSS is implemented with a pair of property:value. Each element
        may contain a set of property:value.
    =   There are 3 types of CSS:
        1.  Inline CSS
            When the styling is provided in the STYLE attribute of the element
            <h1 style="property:value;property:value;">Hello World</h1>
        2.  Internal CSS
            When the styling is provided in the STYLE element. The STYLE element
            is used within the <HEAD> element. STYLE element has less preference
            then the STYLE attribute or in other words, inline has higher 
            preference then internal.
            <style>
                h1 {
                    background-color:yellow;
                    color:red;
                }
            </style>
        3.  External CSS
