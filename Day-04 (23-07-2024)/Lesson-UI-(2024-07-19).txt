    =   What is a computer language?
        A computer language is a set of instruction to the computer.
        The computer language is in form of notation.

    =   What are features of a computer programming language?
        1.  The program is executed by sequence of line number
        2.  The execution may branch to another line
        3.  It jumps
        4.  Loop/Iterate across one or more lines repeatedly
        5.  Ability to solve equations

        3 x 3 - 3 / 3 + 3
        =   9 - 1 + 3
        =   9 + 2
        =   11

    =   There are 3 types of computer languages:
        1.  Passive language
            A computer language that is used for presentation purpose
            only. It doesn't adhere to the features of a computer
            programming languge.
            Example: HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language,
                     SGML - Standard Generalized Markup Language

        2.  Active language
            Are used for solving mission critical algorithmic problems.
            The program resides in the local machine and runs using the
            resources of the residing machine.

        3.  Dynamic language

    =   8 bit (ASCII) can generate 2^8 = 256 combinations
        ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange
        16 bit (UNICODE) can generate 2^16 = 35536 combinations

    =   ASSIGNMENT:
        Create a CMD Help file for your personal use.

    =   ELEMENTS:
    =   What are elements in HTML?

    =   The principal element is <html>...</html>
    =   There are 2 types of elements:
        1. Self-terminated element
            <br>, <hr>, <img>, etc.
        2. Terminator required element
            <html>..</html>, <head>..</head>, <body>..</body>, etc.
    =   Elements are nested within themselves:
        <html>
            <head>
                <title></title>
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>

    =   ATTRIBUTES:
    =   Each of the elements have a set of attributes. Attributes fintune the
        behaviour of the element.
    =   There are 3 types of attributes:
        1.  Standard attributes
            These attributes are create exclusively for the element. These
            attributes are normally not seen in other elements.
        2.  Common attributes
            A set of attributes that is common for all elements. The standard
            attributes are applicable to all elements.
            ID, CLASS, STYLE, TITLE, LANG, DIR, etc.
        3.  Event attributes
            These attributes are only applicable to responsive elements.
                ONCLICK, when the mouse button is clicked on an element;
                ONDBLCLICK, when the mouse button is double-clicked on an element;
                ONMOUSEDOWN, when the mouse button is pressed over an element;
                ONMOUSEUP, when the mouse button is released over an element;
                ONMOUSEOVER, when the mouse is moved onto an element;
                ONMOUSEMOVE, when the mouse is moved while over an element;
                ONMOUSEOUT, when the mouse is moved away from an element;
                ONKEYPRESS, when a key is pressed and released over an element;
                ONKEYDOWN, when a key is pressed down over an element;
                ONKEYUP, when a key is released over an element.
